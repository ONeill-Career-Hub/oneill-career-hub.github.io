## LinkedIn
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) is one of the most important tools you will use to find opportunities, conduct organization research, and find alumni and contacts to reach out to and request informational interviews. LinkedIn is also a place where you can be discovered looking for potential candidates to fill their positions. It’s important to have a profile that represents you well as it will often be the first impression someone has of you.

__Do the following to enhance your profile:__&nbsp;  
1. Choose a professional photo to have on your profile. Generally you just need a headshot; if you feel you would like something a bit edgier, look at the photos of professionals in your desired field and follow their lead. Do NOT use a selfie as your profile picture!   
2. Write an impactful headline. What do you want people to know about you before they take a closer look at your profile?   
3. Your summary is basically your elevator pitch or positioning statement. It should be written in a professional voice appropriate for your intended audience. But don’t be too stuffy – this is where you can let your voice and your personality come through.  
4. Add all your projects, volunteer experiences, and any certifications/languages/licenses that you may not have on your resume. The purpose of LinkedIn is to connect with other people; the more you include, the easier it is for the platform’s algorithms to suggest possible connections for you.  
5. Enhance your experiences by posting Multimedia to demonstrate the quality of work you do. This includes videos, photos, slide presentations, and anything you’ve written.  
6. Request recommendations from previous instructors, coaches, supervisors, coworkers, classmates, fellow volunteers, etc.   
7. Join LinkedIn Groups relevant to your interests and professional aspirations. Interact with members – comment on their posts and send them an In-Message to discuss a topic they are knowledgeable about. Use this as an informational interview. Knowing what topics are currently being discussed will help you ask relevant questions in interviews.  
8. Make sure other people can see you. Include your contact information, and make sure your profile settings allow you to be seen by anyone searching LinkedIn. (Change your settings to private when you are doing research; you may not always want other people to know that you have looked at their profile.)
