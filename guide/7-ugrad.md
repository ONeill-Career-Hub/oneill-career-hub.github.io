1.	Express enthusiasm and thanks.  
2.	Ask for more details IN A WRITTEN OFFER.  
3.	Tell the employer you will review the offer and be in touch within their established timeline.  
4.	Evaluate the entire offer. You should do this with a trusted family member or mentor. Any member of the Career Hub team is available to review your offer with you.  
5.	Follow up with the employer for more information or to negotiate.  
6.	Accept or reject the offer.  

__Review; Negotiate, Accept, or Decline__  
If you want to negotiate any terms of the offer, you must do so before you accept. You should have a conversation either over the phone or in person when you negotiate – don’t try to do it via email.   
To prepare for the conversation, do the following:  

__STEP 1:__ Identify what is negotiable, including monetary and non-monetary items.  

Research the salary range and the cost of living for the city you would be working in. Your contact inside the organization is a great resource for this. You can also use resources such as Glassdoor.com and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   

Develop a budget to understand what your minimum must-have salary is.  

Note that not all components of an offer can be negotiated. Some terms are set by organization policy and cannot be modified. These things might include health benefits, time off, tuition reimbursement, etc. This will vary by organization so good research is critical.  

Consider the following items as you review your offer:  

Monetary Items: Salary, Signing Bonus, Moving Allowance, Tuition Reimbursement, Profit-Sharing and 401(k) Programs, Retirement Plan, Health Insurance, Dental and Eye Coverage, Scholarships for Dependents, Sick Time, Vacation Time, Stock Option  

Non-Monetary Items: Start Date, Review Date, Title, Responsibilities and Opportunities, Professional Development Opportunities, Performance-Based Bonuses and Commissions, Work Schedule/Flex Time, Local Travel (subway or bus pass), Housing   

__STEP 2:__ Define your priorities for this stage of your professional and personal life. Reflect on your values and the kind of work you want to do. Rank the following to help you determine what is most important to you:
Location, Reputation of Organization, Sector, Workplace Affinity Groups, Salary, Benefits, Time Off, Partner Benefits, Tuition Reimbursement, Organization’s Commitment to Sustainability, Relationships with Supervisor and Colleagues, Work Environment, Commute Time    

__STEP 3:__ Understand your market value before you begin conversations to negotiate any aspect of the offer.
Do research to determine what a fair market salary would be based on your education, the years of professional experience you already have, geography, and type of work you will be doing.  

__You should use information you gain from the following resources:__  
Your Network: Talk to your contacts from previous jobs, school, and internships. Though it may not be an exact number, you can get a good idea of the salary range for the type of position you are considering.
Informational Interviews: Don’t hesitate to reach out contacts you met through your informational interviews to continue the conversation with a focus on salary and benefits.
Online Resources: There are many tools available online to help you calculate cost of living and average salaries.   
Some to consider include:    
* Salary.com   
* Guidestar.org   
* Payscale.com    
* SimplyHired.com    
* Legistorm.com    
* OPM.gov    
* BestPlaces.net    

If after your research you decide you would like to negotiate, keep the following in mind:  
* 	Know exactly what you want, and what your deal breakers are. If you know that you absolutely need $50,000/year to make your budget work, do not settle for $45,000.  
* 	Stay positive and begin the conversation by telling them how excited you are about the opportunity.  
* 	Focus on your value-add for the organization. If you are asking for anything above what they have already offered, you must demonstrate how you will benefit the organization – this should be skill-based and supported with demonstrated results from your previous experience. Do not ask for more than 5 – 10% above their salary offer.   
* 	Practice what you will say so you can demonstrate your professionalism as you manage the conversation in a confident and friendly manner.   

__STEP 4:__ Prepare for multiple outcomes to your conversation. The employer could counter by offering other types of compensation, they could turn down your attempt at negotiation, or they could accept. Be ready for every response. Some conversation starters are provided below.  

You: I’m very excited about this position and the contributions I would make to the organization in this role. However, the salary is lower than what I had in mind considering the responsibilities. In view of the work I’ve done in my two internships and the capstone project for my degree, I believe a salary in the lower $50s would be more in line with my skills than $48,000. Does your budget allow for that adjustment?   
Option A: Employer tells you they will need to check internally. Two days later, they call you back and counter with $50,000.   
You: Thank you very much, I would be happy to consider that offer. Could you please send the updated offer in writing?  
Option B: Employer tells you they cannot offer any more money.  
You: I am really excited about this position and would like to come to an agreement that works for everyone. Can we review the compensation package and consider [fill in with your alternative: title, vacation time, start time, professional development, etc.].  
Option C: Employer tells you they cannot change anything about the original offer. The salary and benefits will stay the same.  
You: I understand, thank you for considering my requests. Can you provide additional time for me to consider the offer?  

__STEP 5:__ You either accept or decline the offer.   
__Option A: You accept the offer.__  
* 	Call the person who extended the offer to let them know you accept. Be sure to express your appreciation and excitement to join the organization during the conversation.  
* 	Find out what else you need to do to formalize your acceptance of the offer.  
* 	Follow-up in writing with the person you spoke with and completing any other steps they indicated.  
* 	Withdraw from any other recruitment activities you are participating in as a candidate.  
* 	Update and thank your references and anyone who helped you in the process.  

__Option B: You decline the offer.__  
* Call the person who extended the offer and tell them how much you appreciate the offer. Tell them very clearly that you are declining the offer.  
* They may have questions for you about why you are declining and where you will be working instead. Be ready to answer those questions. Remember, this process is not a game. You are still demonstrating your professionalism and answer the questions in an appropriate way.  
* Send a formal message declining the offer after your phone conversation. Express your gratitude and appreciation for the process and the offer.  
* Update and thank your references and anyone who helped you in the process.
